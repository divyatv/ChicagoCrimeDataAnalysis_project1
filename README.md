# Project01_Panda_UNCBootCamp

Instructions to run the code
--------------------------------------
There are several files in the project.

1) Run start.ipynb - file will load a widget to select timeline, crimetype, wards and other user specific attributes dynamically and plot the data on the fly.
This code calls the following functions.

1. Weather Crime line plot      --     file crimes_weather.ipynb
2. Weather Crime scatter plot    --    file crimes_weather.ipynb
3. Crime  Count on Ward       --       file crimes_weather.ipynb
4. Crime Count Per Month line plot --  file crimes_weather.ipynb
5. Crime Count Per Month bar plot  --  file crimes_weather.ipynb
6. Multi Crome Count Monthly plot  --  file ramesh_Project.ipynb
7. Crime Distribution map    --        file divya_crime_plot_factcheck.ipynb
8. Chicago Attrcations Plot Demo   --  file Chicago_Arractions_Plot.ipynb
9.  Chicago Attraction Plot    --       file Chicago_Arractions_Plot.ipynb
10. SNS plot         --                 file divya_crime_plot_factcheck.ipynb
11.  Fact Checks           --            file ramesh_Project.ipynb & divya_crime_plot_factcheck.ipynb


Note: the code takes 30 mins to run on a 16GB ram machine.
We have user friendly comments in std out telling user the status of loads and plots.

Steps to plot(After the widget loads)
-------------------------------------

WEATHER PLOT
====================
1) Pick a plot type from PLOT section on the left side of the widget.
2) For weather plots, pick crime types and weather condition from the respective widgets. Select years of your choice.

CRIME IN WARDS
===========================
1) Pick 'crime count on ward' from the plot widget over the years of your choice.
2) Wait for the widget to plot the graph.

MONTHLY CRIME COUNTS:
============================
1) Pick crimtypes and year for the plot. Data will be visualized on monthly basis.

CRIME DISTRIBUTION PLOT:
================================
1) Pick start date, End date and API Key. Wait for the widget o plot heat maps on google maps for the crime types you picked.

CHICAGO ATTRACTIONS AND CRIME PLOT:
=====================================
1) Pick year(pick only 2 year timeframe- takes alot of time to plot otherwise) and API KEY for the plot. Wait for the widget to plot most visited places in Chicago. After the map appears, you can hover over the places to find out which crimes types are most prevelant and also the crime counts.

SNS PLOT:
==============
1. Pick year and crime types and wait for the widget to plot the locations of the crime.
Street is where most of the crimes occur.

FACT CHECKS:
===================
1) Plots homicides in Chicago in 2016. Chicago had the most homicides in 2016 compared to entire US.

CHECK CHANGE in % of CRIME RATE over 5 years
===============================================
1) Use branch Divya and run the code - PolicereportSimulator_plotChanges
