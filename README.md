Instructions to run the code
--------------------------------------
There are several files in the project.

1) Run start.ipynb - file will load a widget to select timeline, crimetype, wards and other user specific attributes dynamically and plot the data on the fly.
This code calls the following functions.

1. Weather Crime line plot           file crimes_weather.ipynb
2. Weather Crime scatter plot        file crimes_weather.ipynb
3. Crime  Count on Ward              file crimes_weather.ipynb
4. Crime Count Per Month line plot   file crimes_weather.ipynb
5. Crime Count Per Month bar plot    file crimes_weather.ipynb
6. Multi Crome Count Monthly plot    file ramesh_Project.ipynb
7. Crime Distribution map            file divya_crime_plot_factcheck.ipynb
8. Chicago Attrcations Plot Demo     file Chicago_Arractions_Plot.ipynb
9  Chicago Attraction Plot           file Chicago_Arractions_Plot.ipynb
10 SNS plot                          file divya_crime_plot_factcheck.ipynb
11 Fact Checks                       file ramesh_Project.ipynb & divya_crime_plot_factcheck.ipynb


Note: the code takes 30 mins to run on a 16GB ram machine.
   
2) crimes_weather.ipynb -- file has code to build plot relationships between crime types and weather and wards.
3) divya_crime_plot_factcheck.ipynb 
4) FactCheckPlots.ipynb
